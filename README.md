# Memory Game Project

This is a simple memory game created for the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree Program.

## Installation

This project can be cloned or downloaded from GitHub: https://github.com/gc-decris/memory-game.git

## Instructions

When you are ready to start the game, press the Start button in the center of the page. Once the game has begun, click through the cards and try to match the cards with identical icons. The point of the game is to match all the cards in the shortest number of moves possible. You can restart the game at any time by pressing the reload button on the top right of the screen.

Once all the cards are matched you will be given a star rating based on the number of moves it took to match all the cars.
